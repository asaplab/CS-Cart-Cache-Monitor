# CS-Cart/Multi-Vendor Cache Monitor Addon

This addon provides monitoring for cache invalidation procedures in CS-Cart and Multi-Vendor. It monitors both global cache invalidation processes and small but performance-impacting partial cache invalidation processes.

In case you need a comprehensive project and infrastructure performance study, you can ask for a [Complex Project Performance Investigation](https://asaplab.io/services/complex-project-performance-investigation). This service includes both the infrastructure and the project code performance audit, based on the issues that will be detected as part of the load testing of the project and as specified by you.

## Features

- Monitors global cache invalidation processes
- Monitors small but performance-impacting partial cache invalidation processes

- Informs about ["Rebuild cache automatically"](https://docs.scalesta.com/user-guide/cs-cart/disable-rebuild-cache-automatically/) enabled option
