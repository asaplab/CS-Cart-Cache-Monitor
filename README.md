# CS-Cart/Multi-Vendor Cache Monitor Addon

This add-on provides monitoring feature for cache invalidation procedures in CS-Cart and Multi-Vendor. It tracks both global cache invalidation processes and performance-impacting partial cache invalidation processes.

In case you need a comprehensive project and infrastructure performance examination, you can ask for a [Complex Project Performance Investigation](https://asaplab.io/services/complex-project-performance-investigation). This service provides the infrastructure and the project code performance audit, including the load and stress testing of the project, that helps to find out root causes of performance issues of a web-site.
